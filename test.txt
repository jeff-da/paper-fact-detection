This research is concerned withmaking recommendations to museum visitors based on theirhistory within the physical environment, and textual information associated with each itemin their history.  This study compares and analyses different methods of path prediction including an adapted naive Bayes method, document similarity, visitor feedback and measuresof lexical similarity
In this paper we studythe problem of recommendation systems forthe task of visitorsto aninformation rich environment such as a museum,are interested toconvey predictions about whattheme or topic a given visitor is interested in. We areinterested to get the most out of their visit.As a behaviour to evaluate the relative impact of different factors in the physical space.
This paper proposesa novel approach to measuring the success of machine learning methodsin a user’s selection of a particular exhibit to be produced. An unsupervised framework is usedto jointly compute the likelihood of the value of the best exhibit to be produced. The experiments showthat models produced by supervised methods improve user performance inselecting exhibits over unsupervised methods.
This paper presentsa user-centric perspective on the property of location, focusing on some relevant factors in deciding which exhibit a user intends to visit.  We exploit variation and infrequency in data from the Victoria/Ausland Courtyard (VCA) Collection. We make three contributions: (1) Our experimental system provides empirical evidence for the effectiveness ofsupervised learning techniques in predicting a user’s audience behavior; (2) Our structure basedmethod allows unsupervised learning to be applied to multiple sets of related information. (3) Our experimental system uses unsupervised model adaptation in a supervised setting.
